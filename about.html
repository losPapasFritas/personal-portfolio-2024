                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello! My name is Corbin Rangel. I enjoy working with code and solving problems. While I presently have no prior work experience, I am open to new opportunities. Currently, I am a junior high school with a 3.9 gpa for my entire high school career. Afterwards, I plan to do my general education in a community college and go to a four year college for a major in computer science. During the past year, I have learned how to develop using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and am confident in my skills in these languages.<br><br>Outside of coding, I have few personal hobbies. These include reading and playing games. I have one pet that is an orange cat, displayed to the right.</p>
